<h2>Self Introduction:</h2>

<p>
Hello, my name is Justin Kaloti. I can be contacted with the following email address: jkaloti@csus.edu 
<br>I am a computer science major attending California State University, Sacramento. This is my third semester classes here. 
I am not sure as of right now what my career goal is, but I would imagine that I would end up doing something related to computer science.
My passions include listening to and producing music, watching and playing basketball (poorly), 
browsing YouTube, and spending time with people who want to spend time with me.
</p>

<h2>Programming Experience:</h2>

<p>I am most proficient with C++ on Visual Studio and Java on jGrasp, Eclipse, and Android Studio. 
I have some experience with x86 assembly language and C, and web experience with HTML and javascript.
<br>I would like to expand my skills with C++ and Java, as well as learn some C# through Unity. 
Learning some more python would be nice too when I can get around to it.

	<div class="header3">
	
	<p2> <b><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3959/syntax">Syntax:</a></b> 
	The rules that specify the correct combined sequence of symbols that can be used to form a 
	correctly structured program using a given programming language.
	
	
	<br><br> <b><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/687/semantics-computing">Semantics:</a></b> 
	The linguistic representations or symbols support logical outcomes, 
	as a set of words and phrases signify ideas to both humans and machines.
	
	<br><br> <b><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compiler_design/compiler_design_lexical_analysis.htm">Lexical Scanning:</a></b> 
	The first phase of a compiler. It takes the modified source code from language preprocessors 
	that are written in the form of sentences. The lexical analyzer breaks these syntaxes into a series of tokens, 
	by removing any whitespace or comments in the source code.
	
	<br><br> <b><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3853/parse">Parsing:</a></b> 
	To parse, in computer science, is where a string of commands – usually a program – is separated into more easily processed components, 
	which are analyzed for correct syntax and then attached to tags that define each component.
	
	<br><br> <b><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3854/parser">Parser:</a></b> 
	A compiler or interpreter component that breaks data into smaller elements for easy translation into another language. 
	It takes input in the form of a sequence of tokens or program instructions and usually builds a data structure in the 
	form of a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree.
