		<h2>About Me:</h2>

		<p>
		Hello, my name is Justin Kaloti. I can be contacted with the following email address: jkaloti@csus.edu 
		<br>I am a computer science major attending California State University, Sacramento. This is my third semester classes here. 
		I am not sure as of right now what my career goal is, but I would imagine that I would end up doing something related to computer science.
		My passions include listening to and producing music, watching and playing basketball (poorly), 
		browsing YouTube, and spending time with people who want to spend time with me.
		</p>


		<h2>Programming Experience:</h2>

		<p>I am most proficient with C++ on Visual Studio and Java on jGrasp, Eclipse, and Android Studio. 
		I have some experience with x86 assembly language and C, and web experience with HTML and javascript.
		<br>I would like to expand my skills with C++ and Java, as well as learn some C# through Unity. 
		Learning some more python would be nice too when I can get around to it.
